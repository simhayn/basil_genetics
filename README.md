## Overview
This repository contains code and data for performing genetic mapping and QTL analysis in basil. The goal is to identify genetic regions associated with important traits in basil, such as disease resistance and red coloring.

## Thesis Information
This project was conducted as part of my master's thesis at Bar Ilan University. The research was aimed at advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of key traits in basil, with potential applications in breeding and agriculture.

- **Student**: Nataly Yakobov
- **University**: Bar Ilan University
- **Department**: Ecology
- **Year**: 2021
- **Traits Studied**: Downy Mildew and Fusarium resistance, Cold tolerance, Anthocyanin accumulation (Red Color Intensity) on Leaves, Stems and Flowers, in Young and mature plants in Greenhouse or Field environments. 

## Usage
The repository includes a markdown file [basil-genetics.md](basil-genetics.md) of genetic mapping and QTL analysis. The results are found in the folder[results](results). Here are the main steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 

2. **Genetic Map Construction**

3. **Map Evaluation**
   
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

5. **QTL Analysis**

6. **QTL Visualization on the Map**

## Data
The fictive data used in this project include genotypic and phenotypic datasets for basil. The original data is private.
